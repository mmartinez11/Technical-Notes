# SQL Server
* Microsoft SQL Plataform
* Table Functions return table structures. The table counts as the return value.
* Scalar Functions only return a numeric value. The numberic value counts as the return value.
* Functions both table/scalar have input values like a regular function.
* Procedures are different from Functions. They are not the same. 
* Procedures do not have a return value rather they are much more flexible in their execution.
# Entity Framework
* This is a framework designed by microsoft that allows you to make in code calls to a sql server database.
* With this framework you are able to pull data from the database via in code queries. 
* You first have to set up an incode connection string in order to be able to successfully connect to the database of your choice.
* Once connection is succesfull any incode queries are able to pull from the desired database, as long as you have scaffolded the appropriate tables beforehand.
* In order to transfar data from databases the appropriate tables must be scaffolded from the database into the code. 
* To scaffold a command must be executed in the nuget package terminal, in addition to adding entity Framework into the program.
# Database Release (CUNA)
* For edditing a SQL server database tables the DAC-PAC must first be edited and released. 
* For inserting or deleting values from a database the ADHOC release must contain the specific sql script that you will want to execute.
* DACPAC runs for every table even if it has not been changed. The ADHOC will only execute a singular script that is assigned by a release variable.
