# Basics 
* Java is a static type language. Which means that they perform type checking at compile time, 
  and they require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them.
* Java is an object oriented language that revolves around the usage of objects and references.
* Java uses a JVM which allows Java programs to be run in any system.
# Java vs C++
* Unlike C++ you cannot allocate and deallocate memory in the heap or stack manually. It is automatic.
* Java only allows you to inherit once using the "Extend" keyword.
* Java can use libraries like C++ but can also use dependencies via Maven.

# Basic Class

    public class WhiteBoard {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");}
     }
