# Basics 
* Java is a static type language. Which means that they perform type checking at compile time, 
  and they require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them
  
* Java is an object oriented language that revolves around the usage of objects and references.
* Unlike C++ you cannot allocate and deallocate memory in the heap or stack manually. It is automatic.
